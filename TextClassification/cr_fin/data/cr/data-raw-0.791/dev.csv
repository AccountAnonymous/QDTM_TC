i read many reviews on norton i s 2004 from a variety of sources \( cnet , amazon , message boards \) and came to the conclusion that nis 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update	1
it is an extremely cool cozmo	0
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box	0
7 picture quality is excellent	0
i have n 't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs	0
i must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be	0
the latest of internet security has antispam function that is helpful because i has received a mountain of those these days	0
it also holds a lot more diapers	0
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful	0
there is also no voice recording , something most if not all mp3 players have that the ipod doesn 't	1
travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket	0
the zen was an impressive purchase and i would highly recommend it to anyone using napster	0
the songs recorded with fm are as good as the original signal	0
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	0
the auto focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes they are dummy proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	0
this may be a really cool phone , but it 's not worth it with t mobile	0
there is no way you can talk with customer care about this	1
outstanding signal reception	0
seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection	1
the blue backlight is pretty cool	0
basically the 6600 is a bundle of over hyped features you don 't and won 't need \( if you do get yourself a pda or pocket pc \) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average	1
replacement battery is 50 compared to ipod 's 150	0
maybe this new design is more durable than the last , but i kind of doubt it	1
fact is , it could n 't be easier to use	0
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	0
well the champ has survived it 's first year with our son and it is great ! !	0
the hitachi is made in malaya , and looked cheap compared with the makita , which is made in the usa	0
remote you can stand it on end \( harder to lose \) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s	0
the diaper champ couldn 't be easier to use	0
once you set it up , it 's great	0
all the features are incredibly intuitive , even for a novice like me	0
and we definitely prefer our champ !	0
overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	0
i will also say that setting up the e mail account was very simple and straight forward , although you do need an external smut server to use	0
on the up side , the phone has amazing battery life	0
i also like the lock feature , so it makes the touch pad inactive	0
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority , aperture priority , light metering adjustments , etc , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	0
pc software that comes with the player is not as simple as i tunes but its not bad at all	1
2 \) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera \( semi serious amateur photographer \)	0
the ipod is a very nice product , which given reasonable care , should give a lot of service	0
slick looking design and improved interface	0
this product is absolutely not ready for release	1
the pics can be touched up in photoshop , and be printed at 4x6 and they look great !	0
the little bag it comes with is cheap and useless	1
however , configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours , and briefly made me reconsider my choice to for ego the airport and its notoriously easy setup	1
i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it !	0
the battery is also convenient , but could have been better , such as the zen touch 's battery \( but at least this one is removable \)	0
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included	1
the wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog	0
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	0
i like the size and weight of this little critter	0
i purchased two of these beauties	0
the smooth operation variable speed and a set of good masada bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results	0
i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well	0
huge storage space even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing	0
the color and light i captured with this camera on a 12 day trip to turkey \( gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques \) were far superior to anything i 've ever gotten with a traditional 35 mm film camera	0
i love all of the features , and presets as well	0
i purchased this phone for just 50 and there is no end to what i can do with it	0
has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousands of songs and organizes them great	0
the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me	1
it took me three days , to the tune of neil young 's song `` piece of cr ! `` , to get this to work with the satellite hookup i was hired to connect this wireless network up to	1
i have only used it with the 1 4 `` collet and a 1 2 `` round over bit , but i love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly	0
it 's the same body as the popular elp2 aps camera \( take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you 'll have an idea of the front profile ! \)	0
it came with a good fence that is simple yet precise and thats well made and won 't break	0
the sound is incredible very clean , very wide dynamic range of bass , midas and highs , and can be very loud if i turn it up full blast	0
after getting one for christmas from amazon , i 'm now a believer the digital elph is truly the world 's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures	0
the karma is only 5 more , it 's small , had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including gog	1
to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	0
the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad	0
this is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers	0
it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light	0
its ability to record radio is useful as well , but would have been more so if it could be preset	0
1 it has all the features an amatuer photo enthusiast would want	0
all in all , the diaper champ serves its purpose , but it does not live up to its good reviews	1
the soft start is nice	0
i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera	0
if you buying this player to use with napster to go , wait a while	1
you just can 't go wrong with this one !	0
it worked from 12 26 to 1 9 at which time the picture failed completely \( see other negative reviews my unit was n 't the only one this happened to \)	1
but , i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment	1
the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods	0
it wouldn 't always work seamlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it	1
the scroll bar again takes some getting used to	1
it 's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though i haven 't had to do it yet of course	0
unit took forever since the beginning to recognize and play discs	1
yes , you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle , but then it is gone	1
i had a sony ericsson t610 before this and the t610 is far inferior	0
amazon is awesome !	0
it will not replace your high end 35mm slr but it 's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots	0
t mobile is trying very hard , and again they do have pretty good csr 's	0
the player 's mechanics are also flawed	1
the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while , prompting a reset	1
extremely convenient	0
bluetooth does not work on this phone	1
if you on the other hand always use automatic settings \( and not manual \) you should be just fine , as the camera features some of the best automatic settings i have ever seen	0
i am impressed with this camera inside and out	0
i am a big fan of itunes , simply because it is terribly fast and convenient if you are buying the songs from the itunes site	0
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better	0
4 looks great	0
\) no locked in proprietary business like apple this baby plays wmas too	0
it would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die	1
screen was good , easy to read	0
the size is small \( just a little bit bigger than an i pod \)	0
i do not need to repeat what 's great about this phone	0
the pictures are razor sharp , even in macro	0
the flash is very weak	1
this simple nuance was too much for nokia , and they still refuse to acknowledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free	1
its really cool	0
it also has tons more features then previous creative products , and most of them are very useful such as the ability to customize the main menu to show the stuff you want , not the default items \( creative labs com for more on that \)	0
speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifices the battery life	1
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does n 't load on some computers	1
other than the fact that one can 't delete a file directly from the ipod , the interface is excellent and mind numbingly simple to use	0
2 take around 10 , 000 640x480 pictures	0
cons no am fm radio tuner something a large number of compete tors are doing	1
also , you have to use it with itunes or they 'll sue , dammit ! but itunes is about as good as anything	0
the phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display , long rundown time and a good software suite	0
on my main computer the software did not work right	1
i just replaced my old linksys router with this one , turned everything on in the right order , and it was up and running with no problems	0
so reliability is the winner here for the ipod	0
good color and very little needed to correct photos on paint shop pro	0
for instance , i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r \( w \) and r \( w \) and it plays the dvds	0
fortunately for me , i have yet to have a single problem with this player	0
after a week i tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn 't do anything but turn on my player	1
norton support is completely pathetic	1
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had	0
unlike some of the other people who received a `` lemon `` , my dvd player came in perfect working condition	0
i also had no problems installing or running the camera software on my pc	0
first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod	0
these tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions , and i found the menu to be much more navigable	0
the games are decent , but u only get 2 to start off with	0
this is a great diaper pail	0
comes with a installation cd which instructs you step by step to setting up the router	0
the phone can use any midi audio file as a ringtone	0
if you 've been listening to cd 's in your car for awhile , dealing with the drop off in sound quality may take some getting used to	1
although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent	0
i really liked the price	0
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	0
so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost	0
after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocally that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	0
very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1 4 hp models	0
this model appears to be especially good	0
while i would like to give it 3 5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it	0
as for itunes , i don 't find it to be as good as the windows media player as a computer mp3 player , but it is good enough	0
1 \) great audio quality overall	0
its well made and user friendly	0
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !	0
well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise	1
i simply love this feature	0
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	1
i 'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does , but for me the best thing is that i can easily check my email , movie times , news , or any website with this phone	0
in minutes i was easily navigating through the menus	0
1 pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	1
they have the worst service of any of the major companies	1
second , it is incredibly easy to use	0
if you have an older version of `` internet security `` installed , you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with systemworks install	1
also the battery life isn 't great but it 's sufficient for my needs	1
using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient	0
the blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also	0
there is no fm tuner , while there is no fm tuner on the creative zen \( on the micro version of the zen there is a tuner \) , the iriver h10 20gb , the rio karma , and the audio x5 have fm tuners	1
but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in `` auto `` mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !	0
i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason	1
the zen micro fm receiver is ok , not great	0
this player is an ideal purchase	0
again , the headphone jack on this thing is garbage	1
i sent it back , as i think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective	1
i had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the norton firewall vs the windows firewall , and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because i did not have a `` customer priority id number ``	1
it seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the micro to pull in a strong sound	1
4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worth wile at the price	0
the fm radio 's reception isn 't spectacular , but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area	1
feature for feature , i find it a very sweet little player equipped with a higher end headphone system , between this and th larger zen hardly use my home stereo system anymore	0
again , this doesn 't affect regular mp3 files just subscription drm encoded files , like those from napster to go or yahoo music unlimited	1
it was a very quick setup and installation , in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up	0
there is absolutely nothing useful at the symantec norton site	1
the software is very easy to use , and the transfer is super fast !	0
it 's cheaper , holds more songs and is smaller	0
so far the software for the pc works easily	0
doesn 't have alot of good games on it	1
while i have not had the `` privilege `` , as many call it , of owning an ipod , based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their ipod \( and subsequently purchased the zen touch or zen micro \) , i can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the zen micro was one of the more informed ones	0
the handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving	0
in auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera	0
the battery life on this phone is surreal	0
the voice recorders good , but you can 't record songs off the radio for ring tones	0
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice	0
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	0
up , down , left , and right would have given me better control	1
i have overall been disappointed with nokia in the past , finding that samsung and motorola tended to have better quality phones	1
i like the speed control	0
it is a bit difficult to get the unit open \( the advice to take it slowly is sound \) , but now that our son is walking and exploring , i consider this a positive attribute !	0
the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line	1
with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches	0
it has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass , but i usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish	0
sound quality is great , fm tuner is fine , as is the recorder	0
features click wheel to navigate ability to work with windows or mac optional back lighting \( you can have it on all the time , or have it shut off to save battery power after 5 , 10 , or 20 seconds \) ability to download pda info automatic or manual download from itunes when ipod is plugged into your computer	0
i use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty	0
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	0
well just one con its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze	1
the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect	1
i work on word , explorer , netscape , acrobat reader , photoshop at same time \( meaning using a lot of memory \) , but still dont see a problem with computer \( getting slow or crashing \)	0
not only is it the perfect size \( not too small , not too large \) , it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	0
as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	0
the appearance is okay ed \( at least not ugly \)	0
compared to other leading dd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops	0
the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n 't take up space on your pc hard drive	0
i 've always liked symantec products , except for this version 2004	1
6 the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge it does not charge by usb cable this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient \( additional \) choice	1
even at the `` normal `` setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a `` digital ``	0
excellent range of metering options as well	0
i 've since gotten the linksys modem \( befcmu10 \) and stacked it with the wrt54g router and it works fantastic ! ! !	0
it has n't gone below the second notch \( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it \) , so the battery life seems fine \( so far \)	0
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	1
your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package	0
it will read and play all cd audio disc	0
it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working	1
so the pretty solid router all around good for the money here 's the link to firmware updates http www suavest com forum6 html	0
no more banner ads , pop ups , and the reliable antivirus	0
1 \) price gb of storage	0
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	1
i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptable period of time for something to work	1
after 4 attempted installs , i have finally given up	1
when the player was working it was great , but	1
works great , no odor , and uses regular bags	0
the battery life leaves a lot to be desired	1
the fine adjustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table	1
i also like the fact that you can edit your mp3 titles , etc	0
the achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music , or copy large files over the local network	1
it would just spin up and stop , and display `` no disc ``	1
the video recorders a bit odd , sometimes i get 9 secs on my recordings , sometimes i get 17	1
it really is a great buy if you are loo kin at having just one modem but many computers around the house	0
i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and non responsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	1
the handles make it very comfortable to use and i experience little vibration	0
i still need to read up on some of the security settings , etc to fully understand all that 's up there , but bottom line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the speed boost router	0
and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control	1
just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc	0
secondly , all info can be sent to a computer and w o the hassle of usb wires	0
norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from	0
luckily , with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing ! it is indeed worth nothing	0
who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a `` foreign `` computer just to move over some simple \( txt \) files \?	1
the only knock i have is that the flash is underpowered	1
battery non issue	0
it has never worked	1
main dial is not backlit	1
the radio works excellent in my area , i 'm not sure everywhere else	0
i simply hate symantec i swear , if i could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare , bleeding hands , i would have	1
apart from speed , the signal is consistent and works without interruptions , etc	0
it works well enough \( so far \) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something	0
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	0
sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	0
it 's easy to use not too small , and not too big	0
7 have a good chunk of my small mp3 to listen through the speaker phone	0
the extra spare battery is just a neat bonus	0
its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed 38 phone lying by your pillow side	0
i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession great for action shots	0
no offense to amazon , but i was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks \( i 'm sure prices here will continue to sink \) , and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space	0
navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch	0
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	0
when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off	0
i saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and i feel people are over exaggerating the menu load time	1
multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you 'd expect	1
everything , so far , has worked flawlessly	0
the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this	1
wish i could give it 4 1 2 stars	0
this one is particularly bothersome allegedly one can use the zen micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another	1
i imagine if i left my player untouched \( no backlight \) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level	0
now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will !	1
i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1 2 x 11 with no vi sable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet \( super fine \)	0
it 's faster than wmp	0
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n 't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk	0
dependability i 've seen no glitches	0
i dont especially like how music files are unstructured basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization , like you might have in windows explorer folders and sub folders	1
built like a tank , yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the leigh dovetail jig	0
8 connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company von at 56k speed via bluetooth	0
also , their t zones , although cheap \( 4 99 mo \) never works	1
as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable	1
	0
i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3	0
so i took out the battery and put it back in again , only to find that it would not work	1
what i like the most small and solid feel	0
speed is not a problem	0
this phone has many other features , ir , just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial	0
so far i have used all of the above mentioned features , and find them well designed , and easy to understand	0
both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together	0
i recently bought the linksys wrt54g router and have been very happy with the router itself	0
the cool thing about the ad 2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd r 's	0
i love the es based controls and easy menus	0
sound this is where i love zen the most	0
pros the design is very nice , and the colors are too	0
3 it is slow , if you keep the original configuration and prigs \( why 'd u buy it then \? ! \) it 'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured screen nokias	1
i give it 4 stars only because the installation process or rather problems that may surface during the installation process can be frustrating to the average computer user	1
my ipod freezes occasionally , which is especially annoying when you 're in the middle of a game of `` brick ``	1
hate to wait between shots	0
the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now	1
if this machine just stops on you , unplug it quickly and get out of the way !	1
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy	0
camera quality isn 't bad for the low resolution	0
the photos in the address book are terribly scaled too they look as though they were built out of lego 's	1
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better	0
the battery does not last 12 hours	1
transferring music is a breeze i don 't subscribe to music services , but as mentioned on other reviews , micro allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes	0
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots	0
i have no problems with the touch pad \( once the sensitivity is set to low \) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the pdf manual	0
even with the waterproof housing it is small	0
overall , i highly recommend this phone	0
the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen	0
one downside as of this writing , t mobile has n 't updated their t zone system to fully support the 6610	1
sound quality is amazing i was expecting worse , but its really good \( especially if your files have good sound quality \)	0
perhaps semantic could work out the efficiency a little , but these reviews are highly exaggerated i would ask what else these people are running on their computers \( \? \)	0
the fm tuner , the 5g of storage , and the removable disk are all great features	0
i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures	0
i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him	0
i love the performance and features of this router	0
also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy	0
as any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had simone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image appeared on the decently sized screen	0
they have a good concept here , and i normally expect a lot better quality from creative , so maybe they will do better with the next gen version , but for now i say buyer beware	1
the white led backlit lcd is very bright and crisp , even in sunlight , and relatively easy on the battery	0
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying	0
i do n 't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags	0
this isn 't uncommon in cameras , though , just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries , you should be fine	1
i 've been bothered by blown out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better	1
3 \) the champ is odor free for at least 15 months	0
2 \) music organization is based on id3 \( by genre , artist , album , etc \) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information	1
what this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for different operating systems !	1
simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use	0
being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable	0
besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !	0
this is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support	1
it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market	0
the antivirus feature is phenomenal , and is regularly updated	0
by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it , just be able to put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do	0
as i said , i don 't regret the purchase at all	0
i click pictures in jog format and because the phone has a bluetooth device i find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth	0
it 's worth it	0
also , the fit and finish could be better although this doesn 't detract from performance	1
the player is great	0
if i had to do it over , i wouldn 't buy anything else	0
rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made	1
however , i suspect that many people are having a bad experience do not purchase this product	1
ultimately you will learn just how bad nokia is , and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved	1
all in all , this is a wonderful device	0
i 'd say that this camera is perfect	0
imagine my disappointment , though , when the zen micro proved able to play only the mega strongest fm signals in my area	1
the device looks very cool , i think \( exactly as the photos promise \) , it 's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket , and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice	0
gets nice sound too	0
i thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time	1
the 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of the states and not as well in more remote areas	1
i have not yet used all the features , like the calendar , etc , but as a music player this little thing rocks	0
20 gb or 40 gb \? the pros of the 40 gb comes with a `` dock station `` and double storage space \( 10 , 000 songs \)	0
works great ! ! ! !	0
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy	0
it is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some porter cable models i tried	0
there were many times when i clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens	1
it 's not my first choice in cameras ,	1
the unit is easy to use and intuitive	0
i 've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it	0
but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything	0
and the tech writers have made the installation process so easy for people lick my aunt to follow	0
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	1
it 's a rip off if one buys norton internet security and antivirus	1
what the hell is wrong with this thing	1
it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist	0
it 's a great looking , easy to use device but it 's the sound quality which is truly amazing far better than my sony mini disc player	0
the camera has a wonderful set of features	0
the problems i had installing norton extended way beyond what symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with	1
i wanted standard memory expansion \( cf cards \) , macro mode , and if possible , a waterproof housing \( for kayaking \)	0
a distinct ipod relation is evident with white colored cables , power plug and the very nice zen case with a white rubber inside covering	0
i first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot	0
ok , not quite everything but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it	0
the sound is very nice	0
turn the camera on while pressing the button \( or is it the menu button \? i have to check again \) \) and it 'l show you the time and date	0
size bigger than the ipod	1
you can create playlists , drag drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player	0
3 the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	0
despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography	0
i have ripped over 100 songs from my cd collection and it was so easy and fast , and they all sound great	0
the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with `` canned air ``	1
the ones i 've kept \( porter cables , dew alts , bosch , and this hitachi \) have proven their worth over the years , however , when i need a real workhorse , i grab this router	0
