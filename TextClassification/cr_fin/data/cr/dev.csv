i highly recommend this phone	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	0
after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace , i decided on the s100	1
this one is really great	1
i occasionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly \( yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode \)	0
is not as intuitive as i would like	0
although the sd500 takes great quality photos , the sensitivity of the lcd compromises the quality overall	0
it is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth precisely	1
if you experience problems with installation , you can visit symantec 's website , click the support tab , click the 'home or home office support ' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it	0
the fit and finish of the product is first rate	1
although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent	1
but from my experience , by the time it gets to that point , the bag is really heavy , so i think this is kind of helpful it 's a built in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying	1
3 mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	0
the wrt54g offers excellent security features and much more \( and easier \) configuration menu that i didn 't even need a manual to setup correctly	1
as a windows user , i had to install the software including drivers and itunes on my desktop , and this is the only area where i encountered a nuisance	0
3 band and you can just change the sim card in it to be able to use it in europe with another service provider	1
if you haven 't noticed , they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self timer	1
all at the same time , and all without a hitch	1
the micro seemed like an ipod for less	1
owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide	1
but the major problem i had was with the software	0
mine generally requires a charge every 48 hours or so and i don 't really talk on it that much	0
they obviously have quality and reliability problems	0
about the only legitimate criticism from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder	0
only then did i learn the truth this phone does not work with palm pdas !	0
i want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason	1
they 're easy to use	1
if it weren 't so big i would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers	0
speaking of battery , it 's removable and replaceable !	1
for those mac osx users out there , isync works fairly well	1
it just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre existing router \( mine does \) , without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard wired pc or a wireless equipped pc	0
i would however highly recommend the m12v router !	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the 40 for the 2 year `` no questions asked `` replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days which in itself is totally ridiculous !	0
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well \( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc \)	1
the included software removes any red eye easily	1
5 \) lack of good accessories this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing	0
video output stopped working	0
i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use \( hardware and software \) , playback quality and value for the price	1
the 6600 has more amenities than most world phone , camera \( vga zoom night mode timer \) , video \( w audio zoom \) , speaker \( good sound \) , bluetooth , infrared , modem for computers , electronic wallet , internet access , calendar , calculator , converter and more	1
sometimes when you press buttons , the menu appears after a second or two	0
the pics can be touched up in photoshop , and be printed at 4x6 and they look great !	1
unfortunately , it does not give you the option of installing \( or installing \) them individually	0
when i purchase software , i never want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry !	0
\) one outstanding positive feature is the battery it holds a charge for a long time , longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup	1
the software sucks	0
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance	0
3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use	1
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jv players	1
unless you have an enormous music audio book library , the 20 gb model should have more than adequate storage capacity , with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs	1
works great !	1
it will not replace your high end 35mm slr but it 's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots	1
however , this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes	1
the viewfinder does not accurately represent the picture being taken	0
the dynamic playlists \( `` now playing `` , i be live creative calls it \) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate	0
its a tough one this unless you wan na drive your car over it	1
the headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use , and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony 's i 'd been having	0
i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive	0
i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
even at the `` normal `` setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a `` digital ``	1
however , this product performed well below my expectation	0
the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	0
buttons size is ok for me , my wife , but not my granny	0
the build quality feels solid , it does n 't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch \( both dots and dd5 1 sound good \)	1
so i e mailed the online tech support with that simple question , and got a reply which was totally unresponsive \( it looked as though they didn 't actually read the e mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs \)	0
it is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some porter cable models i tried	1
overall , it 'll make my move that much easier knowing i don 't have to worry about connectivity	1
on the fly play list creation , address book , removable storage drive capabilities , sound recorder , the list goes on people , this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies , it was like halloween all over again	1
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n 't purchase it	0
loading cds was somewhat time consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	0
there is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedious activation process , and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive	0
ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have n 't even gotten to all of them yet	1
the customer support is pathetic	0
this phone is fantastic	1
once you set it up , it 's great	1
who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a `` foreign `` computer just to move over some simple \( txt \) files \?	0
white earbuds \( i replaced those with some shire headphones , big difference \) , a case , a stand , a clip \( which doesn 't really work \) , and a nice little zen micro bag	1
i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon	1
the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	0
the phone itself is pretty nice	1
i wash ours out with lysol each time i empty it , and that helps , but when its hot out well , just be prepared	0
i no longer use it as a plunge router , only as a stationary or table mounted router	0
as far as linksys goes , i have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well no problems	1
bottom line great phone for the time being	1
the plunge action isn 't smooth unless you make it so	0
friends told me that the diaper genie did not work very well , so bought the diaper champ based on on line reviews and i have been happy with it	1
my experience with installation was quite good	1
compared to other leading dd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops	1
the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop	0
the battery life is not that of the casio 's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opinion with the battery life you 've got	1
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard 2 5 mm headset jack	0
the product also leaves a faint smell in the room	0
ive had this phone for a year now and its the best phone i have owned	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras , you get over illuminated main subjects with depth being lost	0
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n 't make that big of a disturbance	1
there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open \( my perv machine did it automatically \) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance	0
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly	0
the eq is awful , and even at top volumes , the bass is flat sounding	0
no problems now , just a sickly disappointment in the way norton has abandoned their customers	0
the vibrate setting is loud !	0
the depth adjustment was sloppy	0
otherwise , i am extremely please with the creative zen micro 5gb mp3 player	1
i don 't know , maybe i got a defective one but first , the player would not shut off , next , the player would not come on i had to send it away to get repaired	0
before you run out and buy an ipod , understand something there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle , principally excellent \( for mp3 \) sound quality	1
on the up side , the phone has amazing battery life	1
it would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die	0
battery non issue	1
this is overall the best point and shoot camera i 've used	1
no voice activated dialing \( what were they thinking	0
creative media source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it , and the file transfers are fast	1
we use the cheap 1 99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around	1
it is hot enough to be annoying	0
1 no direct firewire to the camera	0
it has a nice color screen	1
but , i would definately recommend this phone	1
this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues	0
i am getting better speeds on all my web programs	1
once it froze so bad i couldn 't even use the power button to turn it off , and had to open and take out the battery	0
the player itself has all sorts of problems	0
although i find it more convenient to use 1 touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing	0
also , the display is `` hinged `` and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage	1
this was obviously a conspiracy as it is freak in ' easy to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries ! !	0
quite simply , the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	0
the two times optical zoom operates smoothly and quietly , and lo and behold , a two piece shutter like cap automatically slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off	1
nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together	1
i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it	1
navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch	1
the fine adjustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table	0
but about 25 of dvd 's i 've played on it have a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventually the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments	0
first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
it feels like i 'm back to the days of 56k dial up internet service , even though i 'm running a dell 2ghz pentium 4 with 256mb memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year	0
a larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy	0
apex does n 't answer the phone	0
i 'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera	1
second , it is incredibly easy to use	1
i went out and got the canon today	1
the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for \( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! \)	0
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be	0
the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
i use it in the table \( never take the springs out just attach the fine adjustment knob \) , in my woo drat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances	1
ks almost without fail , no matter what your taste in music is from relaxation music to hard rock , to hip hop , to korean and japanese , to afro cuban and salsa , jazz , blues , country and pop , this feature performs well	1
it 's oval and nice	1
good looks	1
this is truly a clydesdale among the industry 3hp router workhorses	1
so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost	1
apex 's website is down and they wo n 't answer their phone	0
it definitely keeps the smell out	1
let the champ win you over !	1
1 \) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n 't want to bother with the settings	1
of course , if you try to reach symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay 30 per incident	0
uploading music is quick and easy	1
the camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great \( not as good as prints from my pro digital camera , but still very good \)	1
also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and br mp3 cds \( my old apex ad 1200 had trouble with these \)	1
the os is ab it confusing at 1st , but within a few days you will pass this learning curve !	0
i must add to the dismay delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held	1
clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people ! ! !	1
my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software	0
has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range	1
among my requirements for a phone were good screen , decent camera , bluetooth , and gprs support	1
do n 't buy this player	0
have had the nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with t mobile	1
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images	1
start up is so quick	1
doesn 't have alot of good games on it	0
the grain was terrible	0
the only thing i don 't like about it is that you have to buy a larger memory card , first thing !	0
being a past norton customer , i consider this to be a slap to my face	0
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers	1
it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse	1
norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from	1
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high end player	1
this way i never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones , i can get whatever i want	1
you need the software to actually transfer files	0
i am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the `` sliding wrench `` which comes on the router	0
warning ! the windows `` remove program `` feature does not do a good job of this , and neither does norton 's own removal program	0
this camera is great if you 're used to a high end slr	1
also much less stinky	0
i 've dropped it at least a dozen times to my recollection and it still works as good as ever	1
it worked from 12 26 to 1 9 at which time the picture failed completely \( see other negative reviews my unit was n 't the only one this happened to \)	0
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
the arm band is fantastic and it doesn 't budge even at the gym	1
seemed like a good deal , but this pps frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds takes a long time loading and then concludes , `` no disc ``	0
my biggest concern is that i have found nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices , but they also don 't last as long	0
another thing i don 't like is that some of the features take 1 2 seconds to load up	0
the installation software cd crashed repeatedly	0
if you buying this player to use with napster to go , wait a while	0
however , if there was one thing i liked about the creative , it would be the car adapter	1
installation was as near automatic as can be	1
the battery does not last 12 hours	0
the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie `` extras `` on them on the two occasions when i tried to do that	0
3 bags are easy to change	1
i do not count this as a negative , however , because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up ! ! !	1
the height adjustment works well not perfect	1
the sound is great , the portability , etc all the `` stuff `` you expect from a good mp 3 player , this zen micro has it	1
it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great	1
this is a great deal , and i 'm elated with my decision to go with hitachi 's green machine	1
seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly \( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise \)	1
the menu pops up after 3 seconds the picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory	0
yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway	0
which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in midi format for free on the net	1
i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www ipod 's dirty secret com	1
the ease of use of the ipod is a major attribute	1
the accessories that come with the player are great	1
the buttons are rather stiff	0
for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison	1
this is a benefit for many reasons one being just for appearance , your pants wo n 't be bulging with this phone in your pocket	1
because the `` engineers `` at creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack	0
unfortunately , linksys does not write the best documentation	0
the base was deeper and the highs were crisper	1
it 's so cute and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue	1
after reading reviews of lcd problems , cracked , black blobs etc , i figured that it was probably a very limited problem	0
i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money	1
great video clip quality for a digital camera so much better than my old one \( canon a60 \( \? \) the 2 0 megapixel one \)	1
other than this , i am very pleased with the router and would buy it again	1
the ! sound quality is great	1
the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap	0
i saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and i feel people are over exaggerating the menu load time	0
they are sensitive and accurate \( perhaps too accurate , it senses through t shirt cloth , but the touchpad can be locked \) , but easy to clean , unlike buttons	1
1 \) frame freezes and the family yells , `` dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick ! ``	0
while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price about 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots	1
sound quality is amazing i was expecting worse , but its really good \( especially if your files have good sound quality \)	1
the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n 't wash my car	1
2 \) no games it has a cool screen why not use it	0
\( batteries last longer too ! \)	1
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
the phone can use any midi audio file as a ringtone	1
battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargeable , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have	1
it it is a bit heavy for hand held work , but any router this size will be	0
enjoy	1
even leaving it on the default setting \( without the eax enhancements \) produces crystal clear playback	1
i couldn 't believe what i had been missing	1
the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player	0
screen review could be better	0
the sd500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months , and the lcd has been broken twice	0
overall it is a great unit hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it	1
first , it failed whenever connecting to get updates	0
i 've had nokia 's for years , and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use a phone	0
durability not good first problem , if you haven 't seen the news recently , the ipods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months	0
and also , it 's priced very afford ably	1
first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds	0
the front cover \( which you remove to take out the battery \) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid	0
it works well with my vip adapter , which is also a linksys	1
the thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage , except the inevitable scratches	0
it has given me zero problems , and the more i use it , the better i become at taking advantage of its strengths	1
with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	0
i still have my s70 because i like the wider lens sometimes , but in general , if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package , the sd500 is the only one you should buy	1
it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to	1
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n 't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	0
the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect	0
you have the option to have the flash automatic or off	1
it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files	1
the zen plays mp3 , wma and wave formats , which makes it more versatile than the ipod	1
the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi pro pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
about the product the zen micro is a sleek , stylish device that caters not just to `` hip `` youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life , size , or the `` awkward `` factor	1
first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
maybe this new design is more durable than the last , but i kind of doubt it	0
the battery life can 't be very long let 's not be greedy	0
the touch sarene navigation will take a little getting used to , but once you do , and while the zen is still alive , it 's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies	0
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n 't notice after first day	0
it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market	1
the display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary	1
the picture quality of this camera is outstanding \( taking its ' size and price into consideration \)	1
many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective	1
i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all	0
this is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks	1
still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !	1
apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment , and surprisingly wasn 't as expensive as its reputation normally holds	1
i have the black one and adore it	1
however , the creative software is not real intuitive	0
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n 't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything	0
this new click wheel ipod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch wheel for scrolling and click able buttons for selection	1
i also like the lock feature , so it makes the touch pad inactive	1
first , the sound quality is okay , but \( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned \) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes	0
the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust	1
simple to use and hook up	1
it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs	1
the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n 't as easy as the ipod 's , or as `` sexy `` looking	0
getting the router setup in a `` vanilla `` configuration that works for 99 of users was very easy , and i was able to do this no problem	1
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	0
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying	1
the new hardware version does not run linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half	0
my file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites	0
user 's guide doesn 't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website	0
lens cap is a really annoying	0
this is a well made and powerful tool	1
all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n 't done it since	0
it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general to moderate snapping	1
when i opened the box , i was shocked by the size of this thing it 's tiny !	1
picture quality 's great for still and video with sound	1
it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds	1
it 's not the heaviest around \( i think porter cable has that distinction \) , but i found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation	0
unfortunately , after loading 280 songs , all i get now is `` player either not connected or busy ``	0
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down now buy it !	1
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours , and then it died	0
huge storage space even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n 't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with	1
this phone is a winner	1
for the zen creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out , well presented and easy to open and put back together	1
the ones i 've kept \( porter cables , dew alts , bosch , and this hitachi \) have proven their worth over the years , however , when i need a real workhorse , i grab this router	1
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
decent battery on the average size , but the 40gb comes with a dock	1
many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all i would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well	0
the clarity is unbelievable , which means you can cram almost the full 2 , 5 !	1
overall , a very disappointing product	0
the micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface	1
after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has	1
retraction said mine had silver plate it does have display	1
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb	0
also , multiple picture feature is very , very fast	1
as i drove across the country i lost reception only in eastern kentucky 's mountains	1
the only complaint i have is that the 1 4 `` collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1 4 `` bits	0
upside this one , like most nokias , receives a consistently strong signal \( i 've tried some samsung and sony ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front \)	1
also , it takes any kitchen sized trash bag , so there is no special bag to stock	1
i have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it	1
this is definitely one of those products , especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit	0
digital zoom is clear too say you used all 3x optical zoom , try to do digital zoom then just try not to shake the camera at all and you 'll still get a clear good quality picture	1
it works well enough \( so far \) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something	1
this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images	1
it seemed as if we were emoting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless	0
this camera is so easy to use !	1
within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob	0
since zen does not have an external antenna it has some problems catching weak signals but it works	0
nice little phone light compact	1
they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department	1
on the downside , i think the interface takes some getting used to and the zen software !	0
i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my apple power book !	1
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of	0
as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand	0
pc software that comes with the player is not as simple as i tunes but its not bad at all	0
each of the 4 lasted less than six months	0
what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software	0
whichever it may be , i 'm happy i 've made this purchase	1
when you dial a number , you 'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct	0
headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	0
there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !	0
3 \) the champ is odor free for at least 15 months	1
the more i use it and figure out how to do things , the more i like it	1
the cons are n 't really a big deal to me except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files no folder structure and it 's based on the title of the songs many of my songs where separated into folders \( on the pc \) and a few had same titles so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n 't have any that might be the same as another	0
so far \( 3 weeks \) , we 've had no problems with the diaper champ at all	1
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted maybe 10 seconds of wait	0
compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
the price compared to the ipod is great	1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay 300 for this great player	1
it 's also easy to empty out	1
you won 't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks	1
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind	1
overall it is a great value	1
i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players	1
i am extremely satisfied with this camera	1
overall this tool is very well worth the price and i have no regrets about my purchase	1
but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches	1
this product is too fragile for normal use	0
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	0
also , the wma compression format is superior to mp3 , especially at lower bit rates , so i needed a player that could handle wma and integrate well with my windows xp computers	1
so reliability is the winner here for the ipod	1
i tried the cd setup program without any luck	0
the look feel i have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambiance	1
sorts music by artist , album , genre , etc it 's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you 're looking for	1
you hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of seconds to bring up the menu	0
i still need to read up on some of the security settings , etc to fully understand all that 's up there , but bottom line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the speed boost router	1
and for those that are int rested the recharger works anywhere in the world \( and is quite small \)	1
images taken indoor were n 't so clear	0
i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance \( less than 2 ft \)	0
